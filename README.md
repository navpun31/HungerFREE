# HungerFREE

## Background

Food Wastage and Food Shortage are two problems that need urgent attention. We have tried to come up with a common solution to both there major problems. Hunger FREE aims at allowing excess food to be donated from the food service industry to qualified charities that work with the needy. One-third of all food is wasted, from hotels, restaurants and grocery stores. Yet there have been very few efficient ways for groups that have excess food to donate to the millions of hungry hungry people in the world. The app can be that medium. Donors who wish to donate their excess food can sign up and post excess food as it becomes available. Qualified charities in the vicinity of the donors, can claim the food.

## About

HungerFREE is a Java-based Android application built using Android Studio. The application contains an authentication system wherein you log-in as a "food donor" or "food finder". The "donor" fills in the details about the food he wishes to donate, and the finder can locate the near-by donors.
